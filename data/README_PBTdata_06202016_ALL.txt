Preferred body temperature (PBT) data for Melanoplys boulderensis from 2016 experiment examing effects of thermal and light variation	
Animals allowed to acclimate on gradient for 30min before measurements were taken.  Temperature at grasshopper position recorded every 10 minutes for another hour	
Temperatures were recorded by placing a thermocouple on the surface of the aluminum floor immediately adjacent to the grasshopper
