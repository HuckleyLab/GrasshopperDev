Column	Description
Individual	Individual ID (EGGPOD#.HATCHING#_TEMP_LIGHT_SPECIES_SITE)
CCode	Color code painted on individuals pronotum at adulthood.  Only unique within each family
Female	Mother's ID.  May only be unique within a site (i.e. one F75 from B1 and one F75 from C1)
Site	"Site of origin.  All from Rocky Mountain front range (from lowest to highest: A1, B1, or C1)"
Species	Grasshopper species.  dodg = Melanoplus boulderensis and pell = Camnula pellucida
sex	M or F
Temp	"Thermal treatment during development HV = high variance = 28C day and 20C night, LV = low variance = 26C day and 22C night"
Light	Diel light cycle during development. L = long = lights on from 0500 to 1900; S = short = lights on from 0600 to 1800
Transfer_Notes	Any notes when grasshoppers were transferred from the initial communal bins (generally at 2nd instar) to individual cups
Date_1st	Date of movement to cup as a first instar
Mass_1st	Mass (g) at movelment as a first instar
Notes_1st	Notes at time of moving as a first instar
Date_2nd	Date of molting to 2nd (if first instar data present) or moving to a cup as a second instar
Mass_2nd	Mass (g) at molting to 2nd (if first instar data present) or moving to a cup as a second instar
Notes_2nd	Notes when molting to 2nd (if first instar data present) or moving to a cup as a second instar
Date_3rd	Date of molting to 3rd instar (if 2nd instar data present) or moving to a cup as a 3rd instar
Mass_3rd	Mass (g) molting to 3rd instar (if 2nd instar data present) or moving to a cup as a 3rd instar
Notes 3rd	Notes when molting to 3rd instar (if 2nd instar data present) or moving to a cup as a 3rd instar
Date_4th	Date of molting to 4th instar 
Mass_4th	Mass (g) at molting to 4th instar 
Notes_4th	Notes at molting to 4th instar 
Date_5th	Date of molting to 5th instar 
Mass_5th	Mass (g) at molting to 5th instar 
Notes_5th	Notes at molting to 5th instar 
Date_5th+	"Date of molting to 5th+ instar, but not yet adult.  If present, earlier instars are incorrect and data need cleaning "
Mass_5th+	"Mass at molting to 5th+ instar, but not yet adult.  If present, earlier instars are incorrect and data need cleaning "
Notes_5th+	"Notes at molting to 5th+ instar, but not yet adult.  If present, earlier instars are incorrect and data need cleaning "
Date_Adult	Date of adult molt
Mass_Adult	Mass (g) at adult molt
Femur_Adult	Length (mm) of left femur (if available) at adult
Pronotum_Adult	Anterior to posterior maximum length (mm) of dorsal surface of the pronotum at adult
Notes_Adult	Notes at adult molt
Euthanized	"If Y (for yes), then the animal was euthanized.  If blank the animal died naturally"
Date_Death	Date of death
Notes_Death	Notes of animals taken after their death
Ovarioles	Number of ovarioles counted in dissected females.  Could only get from euthanized individuals
Note_Dissection	Notes at the time of dissection
Cleaned	"If X, then the data were checked and cleaned, generally by reexamining the frozen specimen.  "
