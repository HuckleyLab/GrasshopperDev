Critical thermal minimum and maximum data for Melanoplus boulderensis individuals from the 2016 experiment examining the effects of high or low thermal variation and long or short day lengths during development	
"For cold, ramp was 0.08C/min, whereas for warm ramp was 0.2C/min (ish, waterbath messed up some) for the first 2 batches and 0.13C/min for second 2 batches (used a different bath for the second two)"	
"Acclimated 30min at 10C prior to Ctmin ramp, then allowed to rest at room temp for at least 30 min before moving to 40C, resting 30 min, and beginning hot ramp. "

Column name	description
Individual	Individual ID (EGGPOD#.HATCHING#_TEMP_LIGHT_SPECIES_SITE)
Site	"Site of origin.  All from Rocky Mountain front range (from lowest to highest: A1, B1, or C1)"
Species	Grasshopper species.  dodg = Melanoplus boulderensis and pell = Camnula pellucida
Temp	"Thermal treatment during development HV = high variance = 28C day and 20C night, LV = low variance = 26C day and 22C night"
Light	Diel light cycle during development. L = long = lights on from 0500 to 1900; S = short = lights on from 0600 to 1800
Date	Date of CT trial
CT_batch	Batch for CT trial.  Could only examine 20-30 at a time.  (4 batches total)
CT_tube	Tube used for an individual for a trial.  Really was only important for assigning the correct data to the correct individual
CT_min_start_t	time at the beginning of the Ctmin trial
CT_min	Critical thermal minimum.  Temperature where individuals were unable to right themselves within 10s
CT_max_start_t	time at the beginning of the Ctmax trial
CT_max	"Critical thermal maximum.  Temperature where individuals were unable to right themselves.  Much more dramatic than Ctmin.  If couldn't right within 2s, would not be able to right.  Grasshoppers become suddenly heat paralyzed at high temps where they progressively slow at low temps"
