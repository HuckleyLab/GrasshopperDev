First instar hatching data from 2016 experment with Melanoplus boulderensis and Camnula pellucida exposed to high or low thermal variance and short or long days	
All egg pods were placed in the treatments on April 4 2016	
Author: Rory Telemeco	
	
Top row	gives dates in 2016 (2 columns for each date)
Second Row 	gives metadata and then a number alive and number dead for each day.  Each pod was monitored for 6 days once hatchlings began to emerge.  Gives a sense of initial numbers and early survival
